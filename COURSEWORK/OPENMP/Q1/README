THE FIRST QUESTION: 

INTRODUCTION: 

-THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPENMP AND MPI 
-HOW THIS PROGRAM WAS RUN ON THE CODE ( NOT ON THE NODE, BUT ON THE BACKEND and how that was implemented) 
-MENTION HOW THE PLOTS WERE MADE AND THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE ( 100 iteration a 100 times to give a smooth graph)
-MENTION THE '1' SECOND RULE,ITS PREDICTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCES OF TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION (find a paper for this) 
-MENTION THE EXECUTION OF THE ENTIRE CODE LEVELS
	- THE AUTOMATION OF PLOTS
	- THE AUTOMATION OF THE CONDITIONS FOR CHANGING THE CHUNK SIZES 
		- IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN TALK ABOUT HOW THE QUESTIONS WERE DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS, 
		AND HOW EACH QUESTION HAD ITS OWN DATA AND GRAPHS, AND IF THE DATA AND THE GRAPHS WERE COLLATED, 
		THEN EXAPLAIN HOW THIS WAS DONE. 
 
OBJECTIVE: 
	- SHOW THAT THE LOOP1 IS SPEEDING UP
	- SHOW THAT THE LOOP2 IS SPEEDING UP 

HOW TO : 
	FOR EACH LOOP 
	- SHOW GRAPH OF THE SERIAL CODE
	- SHOW GRAPH OF THE PARALELL CODE
	COMPARE SPEED BY DIVIDING TIME WITH EACH OTHER ( and obviously mention the factor of development ) 
CODE:

Mention how these two codes are parallellised: 
	- Mention that only the top loop needed to be parallellised
	- Mention that the second loop had an added level of complexity, one more loop and the iterations got heavier
	- Mention private, shared variables and things that needed to be reduced.
