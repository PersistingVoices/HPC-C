FIRST CHECK IF THE DATA AND GRAPHS APPEAR IN THE SERVER SIDE, IN THE APPROPRIATE FILES

Paralellisation- 

go to /USED    : --run with loops.c and get results. 
		 --run with loopswithpar.c and get result. 

Schedule clause: --make file with schedule clause enabled
		 	-- name: StaticSchPar.c
		 	-- name: AutoSchPar.c
		 	-- name: StaticSchPar.c
				-- for chunks 1,2,3,6,12,24
		 	-- name: DynamicSchPar.c
				-- for chunks 1,2,3,6,12,24
		 	-- name: GuidedSchPar.c
				-- for chunks 1,2,3,6,12,24

FOR EACH OF THE LOOPS ABOVE, DETERMINE THE BEST SCHEDUING OPTION ON 6 THREADS.
		- So for loop1() find the best Scheduling option (either static 24 chunks or whatever)
		- And for loop2() the best might be guided, 12 chunks or whatver

USE THIS OPTION - FOR EACH LOOP AND RUN IT ON 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, THREADS 
		 LOOP1() - ALL THREADS 
		 LOOP2() - ALL THREADS


REMEMBER THAT ALL YOUR GRAPHS ARE THE PERFORMANCE OF A 100 ITERATIONS
 

MENTION THAT YOU RAN THE CODE WHEN ARCHER WAS BUSY IN THE MORNING AND THEN IN THE AFTERNOON, PLOT THE GRAPHS OF THE OPERATIONS OF ARCHER WHEN YOU DID IT.
